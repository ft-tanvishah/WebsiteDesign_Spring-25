                            <i>Charlie, a highly-strung, openly gay over-thinker, and Nick, a cheerful, soft-hearted rugby player, meet at a British all-boys grammar school. Friendship blooms quickly, but could there be something more…?</i>
                            <br><br>
        
                            <b>Originally a webcomic on Tumblr and Tapas, Heartstopper has amassed an enormous online fanbase with over 124 million views to date. Alice Oseman crowd-funded a limited print-run edition, meeting her funding goal in less than two hours. Hachette Children’s Group published Heartstopper Volume One more widely in Spring 2019, followed by Volume Two in July of the same year. Since then, Hachette Children’s Group have published a further two volumes and a colouring book.</b> 
        
                            <b>The Heartstopper series has inspired an outpouring of love since it first published in 2019, with one million print copies sold worldwide to date, sell-out nationwide book tours, and a live-action Netflix adaptation hitting screens on 22nd April 2022, starring Kit Connor (Rocketman, His Dark Materials) and newcomer Joe Locke as the beloved Nick and Charlie, produced by See-Saw Films.</b>
                            <b>Heartstopper follows two teenage boys, Nick and Charlie, as they meet at a British grammar school, quickly become friends and fall in love. Each volume navigates the ups and downs of first love, friendships, coming out, and mental health, beautifully framed by a warm cast of supporting characters.</b>

                <p>
                    Heartstopper is an adaptation of Alice Oseman’s graphic novel series, following the story of Nick and Charlie, two high school students who develop a deep bond that grows into something more. The series captures the essence of Oseman’s original work, blending themes of friendship, love, and identity with authenticity. Like the comics, the show navigates complex emotional moments with warmth and sensitivity, while exploring the challenges and triumphs of LGBTQ+ youth. Both the graphic novel and TV show highlight the importance of self-acceptance, support, and the quiet power of a genuine connection.
